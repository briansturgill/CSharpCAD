# CSharpCAD

This is a port (with a somewhat different API) from [JSCAD](https://github.com/jscad/OpenJSCAD.org) to C#.

We are deeply grateful to the JSCAD team for creating such a great package.

# THIS PACKAGE IS NOT READY FOR USE YET!!!

(But it is getting closer.)

If you want to poke around, I suggest you start in the CADViewer and Python
directories. The READMEs there will help you quickly get started.
You of course need to have the "dotnet" sdk installed on your system: [DotNet Install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/)

The API is still in flux, so please don't use it for major projects.

I have placed it here to facility cooperation with the JSCAD team for
when I'm point to improvements or bugs (amazingly few) out to them.

If you just want to play with it, it has mostly been created on Linux.
I have done profiling of it under Windows (using Visual Studio).
I have not tried it on a Mac yet, but it is expect to work there.
I would advise VSCode with the C# extension from Microsoft installed.
You must have .NET 6.0 installed!
Later, I'll have instructions for all of that, but if you know how to
do it, I suggest you override the contents of cscad/Program.cs with
what you'd like to try.

Remember the API WILL CHANGE!
