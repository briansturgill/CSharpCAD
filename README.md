# CSharpCAD

This is a port (with a somewhat different API) from JSCAD to C#.

We are deeply grateful to the JSCAD team for creating such a great package.

# THIS PACKAGE IS NOT READY FOR USE YET!!!

I have placed it here to facility cooperation with the JSCAD team for
when I'm point to improvements or bugs (amazingly few) out to them.

The API is still in flux, so please don't use it yet.

If you just want to play with it, it has mostly be created on Linux.
I would advise VSCode with the C# extension from Microsoft installed.
You must have .NET 6.0 installed!
Later, I'll have instructions for all of that, but if you know how to
do it, I suggest you override the contents of cscad/Program.cs with
what you'd like to try.

Documentation is at these links:


Remember the API WILL CHANGE!
