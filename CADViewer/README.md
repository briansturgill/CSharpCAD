This is a CADViewer designed to work with external program-based CAD
packages like CSharpCAD and its Python API pycscad.

To use it, run the setup script (to create a .venv directory containing
the needed packages).

You can then start the viewer with the "cadview" command.
Follow the onscreen directions.

The Windows setup script assumes you are using the Python installed
from the Microsoft Store.
